# Description

This is my submission for Dicoding's [Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Back-End](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/271) course that is built with Node.js using [Hapi.js](https://hapi.dev/) web framework and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. The app is also integrated with [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) for sending email notification and [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching.

## Documentation

I have improved the documentation by using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/). You can access the documentation by opening `docs/index.html` in your browser.
